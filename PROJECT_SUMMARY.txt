Uni HUb - Project Summary

Tech stack:
- C#, ASP.NET Core (Server-side Blazor + Razor Pages + MVC controllers)
- .NET 8.0 (TargetFramework: net8.0)
- Dependency Injection, HttpClient; product data served from `wwwroot/data/products.json`
- Hosting model: OutOfProcess

Problem solved:
- Provides a small product-catalog/demo website for listing products, serving product data,
  and supporting simple comment/product interactions. Built primarily as a tutorial/sample app
  to demonstrate ASP.NET Core, Blazor Server, and unit/integration testing patterns.

Impact (speed, scale, efficiency, users):
- Speed: Lightweight server-side rendering and static JSON data yield fast local reads and
  responsive UI for small-to-moderate user counts.
- Scale: Intended for demos and small audiences; can scale to moderate traffic on Azure App Service
  but would need a proper database/cache for high-scale production.
- Efficiency: Low infrastructure complexity (no external DB by default), ideal for teaching,
  prototyping, and internal demos.

Deployment & CI/CD:
- Azure-oriented: project contains publish profiles (`src/Properties/PublishProfiles/*.pubxml`) and
  ARM templates under `src/Properties/ServiceDependencies/*profile.arm.json` targeting Azure App Service (Windows).
- No `Dockerfile` present and `.github/workflows` is empty — containerization and CI are not configured yet.
- Typical deployment options: publish via Visual Studio/Web Deploy using the included profiles, or add a `Dockerfile` and a CI workflow (GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps) to build and push an image (ACR) or deploy to App Service/AKS.
